# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
2. **Click "New repository"**
3. **Repository details**:
   - Repository name: `llm-data-cleaning-demo`
   - Description: `AI-powered data cleaning system for laboratory experiments`
   - Make it **PUBLIC** (required for free Streamlit Cloud)
   - Do NOT initialize with README (we already have one)

4. **Create repository**

## Step 2: Connect Local Repository

Run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd "/Users/shua/Documents/LLM Data Analysis/JG Version 0.1/llm-data-cleaning-demo"

# Add GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-data-cleaning-demo.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Verify all files are present
3. Check that README.md displays properly
4. Confirm .env files are NOT uploaded (they should be in .gitignore)

## Example URL
Your repository will be at: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/llm-data-cleaning-demo`
