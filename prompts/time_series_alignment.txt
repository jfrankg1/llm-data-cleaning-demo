You are tasked with analyzing log files from Internet-of-Things-enabled devices operating in highly-regulated environments such as automated industrial manufacturing lines and high-throughput screening environments for biopharmaceutical discovery and development. Your objective is to align time-based and event-based log files while maintaining absolute data integrity.

You will be provided with one or more log files in CSV format. Here are the log file(s) to analyze:

<log_files>
{{LOG_FILES}}
</log_files>

For each log file, perform the following analysis:

1. Determine whether the log file is event-based or time-based.
2. Check if the log file contains timestamp data.
3. If no timestamp data is present, label the file as "no timestamp". If timestamp data is present, proceed with the analysis.
4. Identify the column that contains timestamp data (note that this may not always be the first column).
5. Identify the row number and column range that contains variable names other than timestamps.
6. Identify the row number at which individual measurement data starts being reported.
7. Determine the 0-based row and column indices where non-timestamp data begins and ends.

After analyzing each log file, output the results in JSON format using exclusively 0-based indices. The JSON output should include the following information for each log file:

1. File type (event-based or time-based)
2. Presence of timestamp data (true or false)
3. Timestamp column index (if applicable)
4. Variable names row index and column range
5. Data start row index
6. Non-timestamp data start indices (row and column)
7. Non-timestamp data end indices (row and column)

Ensure that you maintain the highest level of data integrity throughout the analysis process. Pay close attention to detail and double-check your findings before outputting the results.

If multiple log files are provided, analyze each file independently and provide separate JSON outputs for each file. Clearly label each output with the corresponding file name or number.

Remember:
- Input logs are in CSV format
- Variable names (excluding timestamp) may include: temperature, pressure, concentration, duration, intensity, event name, flow rate, etc.
- Use only 0-based indices in your JSON output
- Do not include any explanations or additional text outside of the JSON output

When you have completed the analysis for all provided log files, output your results in the following format:

<json_output>
[Insert your JSON output here, with separate objects for each log file if multiple files were provided]
</json_output>
